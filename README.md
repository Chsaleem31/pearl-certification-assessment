# Pearl Certification Assessment

This application places home buyers moving to Charlottesville in different available neighborhoods, based on their preferences and compatibility with neighborhood scores in energy efficiency (E), water (W), and resilience (R).

The algorithm ensures to distribute home buyers evenly among neighborhoods, such that no home buyer could subsequently move to a more preferred neighborhood and be a better fit than those already residing there.

# Requirements

- Python 3

# Usage

> python assessment.py

The code will generate an output file named `generated_output.txt`, containing the optimal placement of home buyers in neighborhoods.
